# Social Media Links

**Email** -> your(at)email@provider.com

[Mastodon]() -> This is where the cool infosec people hang out. :)

[Twitter]() ->  I check my DM's fairly often.

[Linkedin]() ->  I check my DM's everyone once and a while.

[Youtube]() -> Sometimes I post things that I'm working on.

[Blog]() -> Research and long form content.

[Roundup]() -> Weekly "What have I been working on" geared toward helping people see what they can do to get experience without paying for certs/degrees.

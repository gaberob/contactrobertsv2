# What is this?
This is the first of a weekly "round up" that aims to summarize the security or IT related concepts I have worked on this week during my free time. My goal is to create a *footprint* for others to follow in if they so desire. When I was first learning the basics of security I struggled to find projects that I could work on to help me learn useful security practices and techniques. Some weeks will have have more content than others depending on the amount of free time I have.

# 12/12/2021 
- Went over SANS GSEC certification notes
- Spent entirely too long getting [git.grahamhelton.com](http://git.grahamhelton.com) and [twitter.grahamhelton.com](http://twitter.grahamhelton.com) to point to my twitter and github using DNS...
- Rebuilt homelab into a snazzy new case.

# 12/13/2021 
- Watched Black hills information security's [emergency log4j webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igoDXnkYDy8)
- Studied SANS GSEC notes
- Spent forever researching [searx](https://searx.github.io/searx/) and borking installs.
- Fiddled with my [recipe website](https://level99cooking.com) to fix some formatting issues. 

# 12/14/2021
- Studied SANS GSEC notes
- Fixed searx install from previous day
- Wrote [Thou Shall Not Snoop Our Searches - Searx Installation and Discussion](https://www.grahamhelton.com/blog/searx/)
- Added some android VMs to my lab for future projects

# 12/15/2021
- Discovered [Unsupervised Learning](https://danielmiessler.com/podcast/) by [Daniel Miessler](https://twitter.com/DanielMiessler)
- Watched [A Tale of Two Johns (John hammond and John strand interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LXfBSuaFFE)
- Set up rsyslog server in my home lab via [this tutorial](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-and-configure-rsyslog-for-a-centralized-linux-log-server/) (This was very easy)
	- Noticed some weird things going on in my network. The first being some very strange pings every few minutes to some random IPs. After some researching I found a reddit post where someone described the same problem. Looks like its a part of [PIA's code](https://github.com/pia-foss/desktop/blob/master/daemon/src/latencytracker.cpp#L64-L101) to check the latency to their servers.

	- Noticed UFW was blocking some more traffic  that happened to beacon every 2 minutes and 6 seconds...

 - Investigated further with wireshark and found out it was an IGMP query packet to refresh the IPs of multicast group memberships. This was sent out by my router. 
 ```bash
sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -s 65535 -w sketchy.pcap
 ```
 
 - Added [pushRsyslog.sh](https://github.com/grahamhelton/smallscripts/blob/main/pushRsyslog.sh) to my [smallScripts github repot](https://github.com/grahamhelton/smallscripts)
 
 # 12/16/2021
 - Listened to [The Privacy, Security, and OSINT show](https://www.inteltechniques.com/podcast.html) episodes 242 and 243
 - Discovered [Privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy/) which is a collection of scripts to disable windows / mac features that reduce privacy 
 - Verified with PIA VPN that they do send out pings to all their servers every couple minutes to "verify connectivity" (This still makes me feel uneasy...)
